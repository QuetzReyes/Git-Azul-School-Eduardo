        Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained
         area of your repository.
         You always create a branch from an existing branch. 
           Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository. 
         You can then work on this new branch in isolation from changes that other people are making to the
          repository.
         A branch you create to build a feature is commonly referred to as a feature branch or topic branch.
